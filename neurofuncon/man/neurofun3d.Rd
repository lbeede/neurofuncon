neurofun3d
}
\description{
 This function estimates and plots a Gaussian Graphical Model (GGM via graphical lasso) in 3D describing the functional connectivity inferred from electro-physiological data (for example, calcium imaging data) collected from neurons on multiple slices of a 3D space.
}
\usage{
neurofun3d(traces, position, all.stimuli.ids, nlayers, ggm.stimuli.ids, num.neurons = 25, num.edges = 25, rho = seq(5,0.001,-0.001), Plot = TRUE, node.size = 6)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{traces}{
    n x d matrix where n is the number of samples and d is the total number of neurons.
}
  \item{position}{
     A d x 3 matrix containing the 3D coordinates (x,y,z) of the d neurons.
}
  \item{all.stimuli.ids}{
     A vector containing the stimuli ids (numeric) related to the n samples.
}
  \item{nlayers}{
    The layers (z-axis) desired to create the GGM.
}
  \item{ggm.stimuli.ids}{
     The stimuli ids desired to create the GGM.
}
  \item{num.neurons}{
     Number of neurons with the highest activation means desired to create the GGM.
}
  \item{num.edges}{
     Number of edges desired to create the GGM.
}
  \item{rho.seq}{
      Sequence of penalty parameters of the graphical lasso. % Don't forget ebic implementation
}
  \item{Plot}{
      Boolean value to plot the graph.
  }
    \item{node.size}{
      Maximum size of the highest activation means nodes
  }
}
\details{
The graph produced by neurofun3d will have nodes with sizes proportional to neuronsâ€™ average activities and colors depending on their variances. The edges indicate positive (blue) or negative (red) covariance between neurons in response to the analyzed stimulus.
}
\value{
%%  ~Describe the value returned
\item{nlayers}{The layer id of the GGM generated}

\item{location.positive}{The starting and end points (x,y,z) of the edges with positive neuronal functional correlation}

\item{location.negative}{The starting and end points (x,y,z) of the edges with negative neuronal functional correlation}

\item{layers}{All information about the layer's neurons. V1, V2, V3 are the x, y, z location of the neurons. 'averages' is the calculated averages of the neurons' activations. 'variances' is the calculated variances of the neurons' activations. 'size' is the plotted size of the nodes. If the corresponding neuron was NOT one of the top num.neurons highest activation neurons, size will be 0.5. Else, size will be equivalent to the average. 'alpha' is the plotted opacity of the nodes. If the corresponding neuron was NOT one of the top num.neurons highest activation neurons, alpha will be 0.4. Else, alpha will be 1.}

\item{rho}{The calculated rho value calculated using graphical lasso}

\item{true.num.edges}{Due to the nature of the code, sometimes the user inputed num.edges will not be equivalent to the true number of edges plotted.}

\item{true.num.neurons}{Due to the nature of the code, sometimes the user inputed num.neurons will not be equivalent to the true number of neurons plotted.}
